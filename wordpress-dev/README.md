# Dev environment
Use the docker-compose if you need a development environment.
## WordPress Backup
Use the [All-in-one WP Migration][plugin-link] plugin to import the backup file.

## Plugins
* Lazy Blocks
* WPForms Lite
* Updraft Plus(I still need to test if it will work. All-in-one didn't worked on dev environment)
